#For this project I am querying data which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers;
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country ='Brazil';

#3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 

SELECT * FROM chinook.invoices;
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.Customerid = i.Customerid
WHERE c.Country ='Brazil';

#4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees;
SELECT Employeeid, FirstName,LastName
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE 'Sales%Agent';

#5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The 
resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.


SELECT i.Invoiceid, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON I.Customerid = c.Customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.SupportRepid = e.Employeeid
WHERE e.Title LIKE 'Sales%Agent'
ORDER BY i.Invoiceid;

#7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all
invoices and customers.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.Total,c.Country,e.LastName, e.FirstName
FROM chinook.invoices i
    JOIN chinook.customers c
    ON c.Customerid = i.Customerid
    JOIN chinook.employees e
    ON c.SupportRepid = e.Employeeid;

#8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?

 SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
 FROM chinook.invoices
 WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';


#9.What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),2) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT i.InvoiceLineid,t.name
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
ON t.Trackid = i.Trackid
ORDER BY i.InvoiceLineid; 

#11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID
SELECT i.InvoiceLineid,t.name, a.Name

ON t.Trackid = i.Trackid
JOIN chinook.albums al
ON t.Albumid = al.Albumid
JOIN chinook.artists a
ON a.Artistid = al.Artistid
ORDER BY i.InvoiceLineid; 

#12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.Albumid = a.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON t.MediaTypeid = m.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g

#13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2) AS Total_Sales, e.FirstName, e.LastName

JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.Employeeid = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.FirstName, e.LastName
HAVING e.Title LIKE 'Sales%Agent';

#14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
